    "Geeth Gunnampalli (aka. The Techie) is a producer & programmer from Coppell, Texas. He began producing music in 2018 through the help and guidance through his friend Zaen Yunus (aka. ZNO). In 2020, he and ZNO joined TWO14 Sound, an independent record group started by Rith Bhattacharya. Joining the group opened up many doors for Techie, and he was able to expand his connections by working with various rappers and producers who helped him polish his sound. They gave him feedback and helped him identify loopholes. After not finding much success with EDM, Techie decided to switch to producing Hip Hop and R&B music. ZNO had helped him through the transition process and taught Techie how to make Hip Hop beats. Techie has shown magnificent improvement from his first release in 2018 until now.",
